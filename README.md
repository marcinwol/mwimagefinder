# mwimagefinder

mwimagefinder searches for image files in a folder and its subfolders.

Unlike normal find/search programs, mwimagefinder **does not relay on file extensions**. It searches and identify image files based on their internal structure. This is especially important in working with large sets of files without or with incorrect extensions. 

The result of the program is a csv file with found files and their basic properties.
